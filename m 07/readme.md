<b>Objective: To save data / value / information form sensor attach to ESP32 into MySQL database</b><br><br>
NodeMCU ESP32s with DTH11 (from Cytron) save humid & temp value of server rack into MySQL.<br>
Carefully check the DHT11 library, it may differ from one DHT11 to another DHT11. <br>
If you wish to add more DHT11, do consider the topic too. <br>
I would suggest to draft the topic first, then follow by the programming.<br>
You may add other sensor i.e. soil sensor (for agro), ultra sonic sensor (for carpark / flood) / gas sensor (for kitchen / clean room).<br>
This exercise comes with PHP files. You may find it in this notes.<br>
