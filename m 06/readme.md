<b>Node-RED Dashboard + NodeMCU ESP32-S ->Serial Communication Exercise</b><br><br>

<b>Objectives:<br>
- Communication thru serial communication port i.e., via data cable connected from ESP32 to laptop/pc usb port,<br>
- Displaying data from ESP32 to Node-RED dashboard,<br>
- Sending data from Node-RED dashboard to ESP32 e.g. switch on & off led,<br>
- Full MQTT broker case study: received value from sensor (DHT11, soil sensor) & send value to microcontroller (LED).</b><br><br>



Watch out with the DHT11 drivers. <br>
You may refer the detail to the store that you have purchased DHT11 or any sensors used.<br>

 
**Node-RED is a cross platform / multi platform that works on various OS or devices -  (***the notes indicated RasPI).
